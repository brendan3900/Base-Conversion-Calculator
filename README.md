# Base-Conversion-Calculator
I made a website that can be used as a base conversion calculator! Fun stuff.

The first page ("Number Converter") of this site is a converter for binary, decimal, octal, and hexidecimal numbers. The second page ("Two's Complement") is simply to
conver decimal numbers to their two's complement representation (or vice versa).

You can find me code in this repository...I used external JS and CSS files in order to keep it more organized.
