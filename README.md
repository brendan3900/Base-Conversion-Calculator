# Base-Conversion-Calculator
I made a website that can be used as a base conversion calculator! Fun stuff. This was initially made for a class project, but I thought it was pretty cool.

The first page ("Number Converter") of this site is a converter for binary, decimal, octal, and hexidecimal numbers. The second page ("Two's Complement") is simply to
conver decimal numbers to their two's complement representation (or vice versa).

You can find my code for it all in this repository...I used external JS and CSS files in order to keep it more organized.
